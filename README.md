# Key_Insepction_by_FSS(Financial Supervisory Service)
The project focuses on key inspection areas provided by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) in Korea. Python is used to clean and process the data, which is then visualized using Tableau. To streamline the data handling, I created a process_data function in funct.py that efficiently reads and merges commonly used data, which is then utilized in both FSS.py and KICPA.py.
