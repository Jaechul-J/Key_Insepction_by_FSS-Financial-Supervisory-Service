# Key_Insepction_by_FSS & KICPA
The project focuses on key inspection areas provided by the KICPA in Korea. OpenDart API is used to retrieve data from OpenDart and other datas are retrieved from ValueSearch. Python is used to clean and process the data, which is then visualized using Tableau. To streamline the data handling, I created a process_data function in funct.py that efficiently reads and merges commonly used data, which is then utilized in both FSS.py and KICPA.py.

## Steps
### 1. Data Collection


### 2. Data Tidying

### 3. Tableau Output
